Roman Numerals
=======================

## What is it?

A programme that converts arabic numbers from 1 to 3999 into roman numerals. This Kata was given to us as a day challenge on week 3 of Makers Academy.

## How was it built?

I pair-programmed with [Lovis Schultze]. Before rushing into the code, we sat down and thought together about how we were going to solve it.

We TDDed it using Rspec and Ruby.

## What did I learn?

This one of my favorite projects at Makers Academy for two reasons:
- Lovis and I really broke down the problem together and discussed each step, it was the first time I realised how enjoyable pair-programming can be.
- We were so proud not only to have built a working solution, but also to have solved the problem faster than the coach expected us to. However the next day the coach showed us a much more beautiful and concise way of coding a solution, and we were very humbled. I included the beginning of it in lib.
